# Capstone Project : Unraveling the Team Composition Influence in TFT 


With the massive growth of e-sports and competitive online games, developers strive to come up with a revolutionary new genre that may shape the future of e-sports.  In 2019, a new type of online game, aka “auto-chess” has been on the rise and Riot Games has created a version of their own by the name of Team Fight Tactics with expectations of mobile releases in 2020.

### Problem Statement

Certain final team compositions and item builds may affect the outcome of a random match in a TFT.  Depending on what strategy an individual takes, a player can gain an advantage over other players slightly.  Using clustering models, we will explore if there is a significant evidence that certain team composition and item choices yield better placements.

### Modeling 

#### Clustering
 #### k-means
     - separate EDA on different clusters after modeling based on quartile placements (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8)
 
 #### DBSCAN

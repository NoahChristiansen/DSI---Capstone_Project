skitlearn has ordinal classfication
multiclassification but with ordinal classes.  
outliers cut-off values?

if goal : 
predict outcome of match? 
ensemble methods








if not supervised, do not utilize win rate % 
or.... classification?








Riley:
clustering?
PCA - feature extraction (KNOWING some piece classes can pair with each other...)
ranking model - categorize based on 'placement' to create a multiclass model.
maybe use quartile ranges?
AUC & average precision?
COULD use binary model but... 1-8 placements?

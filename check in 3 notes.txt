k-means - clusters themselves need to represent 'placement' and maybe we can test for accuracy of our model in predicting placement... 
dummy value that is a combination of my units 1010111001 so that I can cluster and segregate difference?
use silhouette scores to compare clusters of 1-8 ?


GOAL : i want to know which team composition yield best placement.
decision tree , tree based
exboost

go with pca?
- dimensional reduction using feature extraction would be good for 'unit' combinations


total units = 10

berserker_0 - combination of 3 units with units.class = berserker
berserker_1 - combination of 6 units with units.class = berserker

or I can look at individual values of the units and find new meaningful insights via cluster? (maybe some units are better together "not specified by combination bonus")
but would still have to transform dummy columns as : 1100

Additional to test but modeling..?
what about particular unit + item? any stand out?


clusters without the features to predict underlying values of the features (represented as cluster)
